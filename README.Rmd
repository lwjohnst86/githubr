The goal of githubr is to simplify using GitHub's API. Uses the wonderful [gh] R
package. Inspiration also comes from the [gitlabr] package.

[gh]: https://github.com/r-lib/gh
[gitlabr]: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gitlabr

## Installation

You can install the development version of githubr with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lwjohnst86/githubr")
```

## Examples

Currently, most of the functionality revolves around Issues. For example, to
list issues or labels:

```{r}
library(githubr)

# See issues
gh_list_issues("lwjohnst86/carpenter")

# See labels.
gh_list_labels("lwjohnst86/githubr")
